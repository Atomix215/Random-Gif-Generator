# Random Gif Generator

## Description
The Random Gif Generator is a web application that allows users to generate random GIFs or search for specific GIFs using the Giphy API. The application features two main cards: one for generating a random GIF at the click of a button, and another with an input box where users can request a GIF based on their input.

### Custom Hook
This project includes a custom React hook for fetching and generating GIFs. The hook abstracts the API calls and state management, making the component code cleaner and more manageable.

## Features
- **Random GIF Generation**: Click a button to get a random GIF.
- **Search Specific GIFs**: Enter a keyword to search and display a specific GIF.
- **Custom Hook**: Utilizes a custom React hook for fetching and generating GIFs.
- **Responsive Design**: Styled using Tailwind CSS to ensure a responsive and attractive user interface.
